# Districts
Districts is like GriefPrevention, but players can sell/buy, lease/rent their claims!

Spigot: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/districts.99234/

# IMPORTANT NOTICE:

This Plugin works fine at the moment, but there can be some Errors. Because of this we are rewriting the complete System atm so it will be better than before. You will still be supported if any Errors occure, but we won't add new features in the 1.0 generation!
An exact date of release for Districts 2.0 can't be saied yet but we work to release it mid Summer this year.
But don't worry, you will be able to migrate every data of the 1.0 generation to the 2.0 generation with one command.
